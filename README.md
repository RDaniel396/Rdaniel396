# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Richard Daniel  
---
  I am PhD graduate researcher formerly in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Sheffield.
  Now, I am working and living in London, looking for a new adventure outside academia.
  Other than being a scientist, I am best described as a model builder, analyst, and researcher, working mainly with Python.

## Publications

My published scientific work can be below:


### [Forecasting Dark Energy parameters from simulated gravitational waves](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06544.pdf)
Simulation of two future observations, creating mock data to forecast the statistical constraints on dark energy parameters.

### [Inflation and Scale-invariant R2-Gravity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11719.pdf)
A simulation of the beginning of the Universe, assuming an extension to a well-motivated model, utilising complex mathematical and dynamical system analysis.

### [Transitioning from a bounce to R2 inflation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.01093.pdf)
Data visualisation of dynamical systems in the early universe, probing for new insights into divergent systems.
